Project

My project will be a casino rulette, so my main classes would be: 'Bet', 'Player' and 'Rulette'. So the general idea is to do da rulette where the player do his bet and the rulette
gives the random number and gives the pay as the pay method indicates
This program will allow you to: Put an initial initial bank.
Different kind of bets like: Color, Number or row, odd or even.
It simulates the rulette spin and calculates the win and lost
Refresh the bank depending on the result of the bet

How to compile: Make sure all .cpp files are in the same directory. Then open a terminal in that folder and compile the project using the following command:

g++ project.cpp -o rouletteGame

This will generate an executable file named rouletteGame. To run the program:

On Linux or macOS: ./rouletteGame

On Windows: rouletteGame.exe

The game will start in the console and prompt for player setup and betting options.
