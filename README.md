Project

My project will be a casino rulette, so my main classes would be: 'Bet', 'Player' and 'Rulette'. So the general idea is to do da rulette where the player do his bet and the rulette
gives the random number and gives the pay as the pay method indicates
This program will allow you to: Put an initial initial bank.
Different kind of bets like: Color, Number or row, odd or even.
It simulates the rulette spin and calculates the win and lost
Refresh the bank depending on the result of the bet
